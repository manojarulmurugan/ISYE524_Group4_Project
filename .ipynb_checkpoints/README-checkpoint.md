1. working code for minimize distance problem
    not allowed to visit a port more than once
    only allowed to travel to the nearest 8 nodes
    there can only be one terminal port - not having this allows multiple open paths
    MTZ constraints are required to eliminate loops - not having this allows multiple closed paths
